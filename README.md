This repository contains Database-Design-Development---HTTP-5126-0NB.

In this course, I explored strategies and techniques for designing, creating, and interacting with databases. The course primarily focused on SQL and MySQL, giving me hands-on experience in data manipulation, database schema design, and query optimization. Additionally, I received an introduction to NoSQL databases, expanding my understanding of non-relational data storage options.
